## To use my project locally, you would need to download my project and inside of it run the following command

    npm install

After all packages have been installed, you can run the command:

    npm run dev

As you are doing it in the console, you should be able to see the URL link. Once you go to that link you will be able to see my website.

## To-do list

- Instead of having two separate components Film and Character have one component
- Improve styling
- Fix the issue on Netlify with page loading after being reloaded
